# Code

## Correctness
Overall there are a few things to work on. Mistakes are listed below:
- on line 5 you've added in some unnecessary code after declaring your constant. <T> is not needed here. Additionally you've switched around your type declaration and variable declaration in the parentheses when referring to T. Your type declaration for shift is also incorrect.

- In your while loop, wherever you have referred to string, this must be changed to T to mach the variable defined in your function.

- When calling the function at the end, consider using the console.log function as opposed to print().

## Efficiency
- This is a fairly efficient manner to go about solving this challenge.

## Style
- Consider using 4 Tab spaces as opposed to 2. It can help to increase readability and is considered to be a standard.
- be consistent in the way you use braces. This is especially prevalent in lines 13 to 15. Move you closing brace underneath the code line to be more consistent with the rest of your code. 

## Documentation
- On the whole you have documented your code fairly well. Consider being more descriptive and using specific language. E.g on line 42 use 'increment' rather than 'increase'.

### Conclusion
- This is a well thought through solution and with a few corrections it should be working perfectly. Pay close attention to what you name things and work on consistency and you'll be flying in no time. Test your code in incremental steps to snuff out errors as they arise. Be decriptive with your variable and constant names so there is no doubt as to what is contained in them. Well done on getting this far. I look forward to reviewing this again once corrections have been made.
